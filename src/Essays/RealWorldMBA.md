# My Real World MBA

Tim Ferriss inspired me to be unemployed for a year. His article "How to Create Your Own Real World MBA" helped me to quit my job, switch industries and ultimately kick off the type of career that I was meant for.

Going into college I didn't know what I wanted to do but I had the opportunity to go so I figured I should take advantage of it. I decided to major in Business Administration so I'd at least learn a bit about people, money, and how businesses work, while I decided what I really wanted to do.

Five years later I was a year into working at my family's wholesale lumberyard and I was miserable. I had great long term prospects but I was bored, lonely, and was looking at spending the remainder of my 20s in these conditions. I really wanted to be somewhere where I could work around young people and solve difficult problems.

## The Spark

Around this time I told Patrick, a developer friend of mine about an app idea I had. The next day he emailed me a demo. He had built my idea in twenty minutes during his lunch break.

I knew I wanted a job where I could spend more time solving problems, but it was not until this moment that I could see a clear path ahead of me. If Patrick could build my idea in twenty minutes it shouldn't take me more than six months to be able to learn the basics.

Another friend sent me a Udemy course on Javascript and told me to try out the first few lessons. Four hours into the course—and another eighty hours of existential crisis level boredom at work—I knew that I at least needed to try to pursue programming.

The problem was I didn't want to get another undergraduate degree, I had just gotten one. And I didn't know if I'd be able to get into grad school for computer science with a business degree or if I'd be able to pay for it without taking out a loan.

## Two Options

I decided I had two courses of action:

1. Get a job similar to the one I had, but somewhere that would allow me to have a better schedule and younger coworkers—but risk being in a pretty similar situation with significantly less financial upside.

2. Pursue a career in programming with the risk of not getting into or not being able to pay for grad school, never getting a job, spending a ton of money supporting myself during the process, then having to go with option one anyway.

## Enter Tim Ferriss

This is where Tim comes in. I had heard him tell the story of his "Real World MBA" and I decided to revisit it and see if I could do something similar.

> "I decided to make (in my mind) a two-year 'Tim Ferriss Fund' that would replace Stanford business school... For the 'Tim Ferriss Fund,' I would aim to intelligently spend $120,000 over two years on angel investing in $10-20,000 chunks, so 6-12 companies in total. The goal of this 'business school' would be to learn as much as possible about start-up finance, deal structuring, rapid product design, initiating acquisition conversations, etc."

By the way—at the end of the two years his portfolio was up 400%.

After rereading this article my decision was made. I would apply to grad school and if I didn't get in with some kind of assistantship or student job to pay my tuition, I would create my own masters of computer science program.

## The Grind

I spent most of the next year in coffee shops, coding along with Udemy courses and working on projects.

At one point I got so fed up living off of my savings account that I got a restaurant job. Having a paycheck again was nice but I hated the job and was constantly wishing I could be studying instead of sitting around waiting for tables to fill up.

This was the first time in my life I was excited to study. I would plan projects and test myself on syntax in my server book. I was constantly thinking about programming and it showed—I was a terrible server, but I was tearing through Jonas Schmedtmann's React course.

I would leave work, go to my favorite coffee shop, study until close, go home, go straight to bed, then wake up and either go to work or go straight back to Jet for a morning study session. I worked out a lot, played a lot of guitar, and never missed an event with my friends, but I spent the majority of my time writing code.

## The Breaking Point

The job was slow and a couple months in I got fed up sitting around half the time and decided to quit. I had just applied to my first internship and grad school, and I decided that if I didn't get into one of them I was going to start treating studying like a full time job. 9-5 at the coffee shop—studying, building, and applying to jobs until I got something.

At this point I knew my first Javascript framework and I was done playing around. It was time to bite down on the bit and really put some time in. I planned to quit my job at the end of my next shift.

That night I got sent home because "it was slow and there were too many servers". I didn't get scheduled that weekend. I went in and spoke to my manager about it and he said it wasn't working out.

I effectively got fired three hours before I planned on quitting.

I guess I shouldn't have spent so much time sorting arrays at work—but I wasn't upset. I now had control of my time back and fresh motivation to grind.

I got the internship two weeks later.

## Where I Am Now

Eighteen months after quitting my job and setting out to create my own CS Degree, I have an internship under my belt and I'm five months into a web dev job at a startup five minutes from my house. On top of that I'm preparing to launch my first iOS app in the next few weeks.

Tim's article gave me a plan of action, and the permission to take a big risk in hopes of improving my life. I now have a new skillset that has greatly broadened my ability to solve problems, have more control of my time, and have a great job.

Since following Tim's lead my quality of life has skyrocketed and I'm hoping my current side project will help me to say the same about my finances by the end of the year.
